The doppels, or doppelgangers, are alien beings from another universe. Making use of the portal technology that was, up until this point, unusable due to how it was buried. 

Upon arrival in our universe, they start a silent invasion of Earth's many powerful institutions. 

They eventually get caught, which triggers a terrible war in which humans bioengineer a virus to wipe them out. 

The Homeworld: 
	Doppels do not look like humans by sheer coincidence, rather, it has to do with the technology of this species. Rather, they inhabit a flesh universe. This is because of how the doppels are actually genetically engineered cadavers being piloted by a superintelligent brain parasite. 
	
	Doppels use these bodies to infiltrate and exterminate foreign life, and then proceed to convert biomatter into flesh farms that then expand throughout the cosmos. 
	
	Their interuniversal travel is a quirk of their evolution. As they convert more and more planets and solar systems and eventually galaxies into large nodal clusters of flesh farms, they accelerate the laws of thermodynamics, resulting in the universe heating up drastically. This in turn causes thermal energy to be trapped in vacuums, which in turn accelerates radiation. The result is that the universe grows "pourous", removing excess heat through millions of wormholes. 
	
	Doppels use this universal heat cycle to move from one universe to the next, converting it into flesh before it burns itself out completely.
