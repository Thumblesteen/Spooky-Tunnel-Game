[MR_GESTAPO<number_withheld_by_legal_order>]
	oh thats right, ur actually kinda smrt huh? I get that. Part of my job is to write like an insipid yokel. It helps so you don't draw attention to yourself when asking innocent questions and participating in harmless dialogue among friends. 
	
	Here's the thing Clara: You are burdened with a conscience. I am not. So I'm going to give you a choice. Remember that kid who started the thread? He's a real bright boy. Could go far in life. Keyword being COULD. 
	
	Either you get your ass back here pronto, or I'm gonna take my frustrations out on the kid, got it?

[Clara_Underwood<+195-221-30-C-22>]
	You're fucking sick. U know that?! You are a sick piece of shit, and I hope you get cancer!

[MR_GESTAPO<number_withheld_by_legal_order>]

	Just sitting in my car. Got a pierogi, ever tried a pierogi? It's like a Polish taco pie. It reminds me of the first time I... well, that's not important. I just mean, I like to have a pierogi before I'm about to... well, y'know... 

[MR_GESTAPO<number_withheld_by_legal_order>]
	I'm sharpening my knife. I like to keep my knife sharp for when I'm... cutting my pierogi. Have you ever... cut a pierogi, Clara? It's like meditation for the soul. It makes your entire body still, like dark and endless water. It's beautiful. 

[Clara_Underwood<+195-221-30-C-22>]

[BIG_BAD_OULF<number_withheld_by_legal_order>]
	Ohohohohohoh Yes mistress

[Dea_Tacita<number_withheld_by_legal_order>]
	Listen carefully: Not every woman you meet is going to be some meek and gentle thing like your targets. If you disrespect me again then I will make a clear example of you. 

[BIG_BAD_OULF<number_withheld_by_legal_order>]
	Hey, I was just kidding around, huge respect for the queen bee. For real, it's an honour to work with you and I promise I will be on my best behavior.  

[Dea_Tacita<number_withheld_by_legal_order>]
	I should certainly hope so. I don't give men a second warning. You'll just disappear. No fanfare. 

[BIG_BAD_OULF<number_withheld_by_legal_order>]
	Understood commander.
