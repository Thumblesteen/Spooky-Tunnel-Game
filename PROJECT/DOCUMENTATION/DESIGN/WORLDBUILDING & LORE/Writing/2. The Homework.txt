	"Need help with school assignment abt tunnel men"
	[ACCOUNT_DELETED] Justin847 (NEW USER!):
		hey everyone my names Justin and im doing a report on the tunnel men, and i want to make sure my details are all good because i know a lot about them now and how they help keep the planet working with modern technology and i deeply respect both them and all of you. i say this because the problem i am having relates to a very sensitive topic. so trigger warning for anyone who is in morning. 
		
		i looked in the penal worker database and learned how the employee numbers were and then i used the public tax records to confirm since u can see that under the disclosure act thing. nyways i saw how the employee numbers were correct but then it got strange. nd its because i want to do this topic a lot of justice that i have 2 make sure i am right. but when i looked at the market records at sectorwide mortality rates the numbers did not add up. maybe its because im a kid and i dont know but it seems like the penal worker database is higher than the market records by A LOT. 
		
		so i then decide to use this forum to try and see where the truth lies, i asked the datacrawler to compare the percentage of users on this forum who post on Widows with the death statistics nd i found something that looks really strange
		
		it says 98% of you post on the widow forums. so i think maybe i am using a bad metric because of how people send love and support. but then i see posting rules about how it actually is only for widows and i thought maybe its an old rule and people stopped caring abt it so i looked further.
		
		and i see the opposite. i see constant dogpiling on new users who post in there without knowing better (no judgement ofc people shouldnt disrespect you when ur grieving) but the point is that it is clearly a super strict rule.
		
		so like can someone tell me how it really works? because i want to do a memorial poster with the real number of casualties since i cant fit everyones names on there and i think it is important people know

			dnt worry hun i dont think U come off as disrespectful i am a widow and it seems like ur just being considerate to us :)
		
		[BANNED_USER] smanda:
			wow thats actually really weirddd... is the forum full of fake widows or smth???? asking since i am also a widow nd THIS IS SERIOUS
		
		[BANNED_USER] STFU_PLZ: 
			holy shit. just looked up the same exact numbers and even verified it using internal government records (im a tax official), and the kid is right! 98% of us on here are somehow posting on Widows
			
		[BANNED_USER] IF_U_READ_THIS_IM_GAY (NEW USER!): 
			omggg is this true??? how is this even possible??
		
		[BANNED_USER] Anastasia_Hemlock:
			Yup. Just did what STFU did and got the same results. This must be some kind of bug.
		
		[BANNED_USER] STFU_PLZ: 
			uhm. since this is serious, i kinda used my tax auditing software to access stuff that i seriously shouldnt be accessing... and there is something RLY fucked up going on 
			
			i am downloading a huge infodump as we speak, and i am glossing through a handful of the more interesting stuff i downloaded manually. there is something INCREDIBLY FUCKED UP with the death records. Because the insurance companies as well as the funeral directors and coroners must keep their own records, and these all can be easily compared due to standardised forms. 
			
			and... the insurance company is 98%. the other two are not possible to estimate due to how they are not just full of missing personnel entries, but also has lots and lots of duplicate ones. like someone mutilated these two documents, and i cant find a copy anywhere else. 
			
			this is actually kinda fucked up u guys

			i just got back from violin practice, wthck is going on????

			good 4 u 4 not swearing Justin. its good to know when to keep ur fuckig mouth closed >:) 
			
			now do the government a favor and dont ever fucking bring this up again Justin. i like U :) but i cant protect you. i cants protect ur mommy or daddy or ur little kittycat... whats her name again? Rosebud? So adorable Justin. You're a lucky boy. You got an idyllic childhood. 
			
			You know what 'Idyllic' means? It comes from the Greek "idyll." Which quite literally means "to be in a happy situation." My childhood was not idyllic Justin. In fact, I had to struggle a lot to get where I am. I know the value of my work and my position in the government. 
			
			You see Justin, my childhood was dystopic. That's kind of like the opposite. Dystopic is when your parents just disappear one night. Just dragged out into the infinite darkness never to be seen again, as you and your poor crippled little sister have to live alone. in the streets. like rats. 
			
			And you know what happens to rats, don't you? They get eaten by bigger animals. Especially when they're too crippled and UNGRATEFUL to outrun you. 
			
			So be sure to keep quiet about this Justin, and deliver some prosaic flowery patriotic bullshit about friendship and pride, and just a helping of meaningless vapid state worship, and how our lawns are the greenest and our puppies are the cutest, and how every soldier has a heart of gold and how every kid can dream of a brighter future... y'know... like a well-behaved and most importantly - STUPID - peasant, GOT IT? 
			
			Now, if you excuse me Justin, I'm gonna go ahead and tidy up this mess you stepped into. I got some tax employees to delete. Haha, sorry, typo. I meant tax records. hahah. 
			
			ohboy justin we sure do have fun dont we? and if u ever need my help then just stand next to a household appliance of ur choosing nd ask as loud as u can :P
