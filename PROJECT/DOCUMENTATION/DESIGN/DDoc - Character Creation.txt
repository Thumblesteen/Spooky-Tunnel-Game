So I had an awesome idea for character creation. Your class selection is based
on the crime you committed. Have some good ideas so far: 
	
	Serial Killer: 
		Serial killers are good at using power tools, and gain bonuses to that.
	
	Contract Killer: 
		Contract killers are good at bypassing security and locks. 
	
	Spree Killer: 
		Spree Killers gain a bonus to movement and mobility. 
	
	Death Cultist: 
		Death Cultists are good at manual labour and gain bonuses to maintenance
		tasks.
	
	Terrorist:
		Terrorists have bonuses to using technology. 

Now the reason why the player can be despicable criminals like these in the game
is because of its setting, you're not actually around any living human beings
to inflict harm upon. The despicable elements of these things disappear from the
story, and instead it creates a creepy sense of futility as the player has to
keep this character alive throughout the story. Plus, it is kind of hilarious to
go to your save files and see "Character Name, Level 5 Serial Killer" 

On top of this, one part of the punishment is a chemically induced amnesia. This
is said to be for rehabilitative purposes, to remove the bad personality. But 
there are conspiracies on WorkNet suggesting that the amnesia is just a smoke
screen for a new type of slavery that relies on guilt and isolation. 

I like it because it's edgy without being gross or crossing the line.
